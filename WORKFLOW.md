# Data Collection Workflow

End-to-end pipeline for reproducing a study wave: collect ChatGPT/Gemini responses, scrape the Bing/Google results behind them, match, and enrich. Each step lists its **input**, the **tool/command**, and the **output** with a real sample.

> **Where things live:** this repo (the data viewer) bundles the **browser extensions** (`tools/`), the **v1 study data** (`datapass/`, `data/`), and the viewer. The **Node/Python collection scripts** referenced below as `scripts/…` (SerpApi collector, citation-mapping, content fetcher) live in the main research repository — they are not in this repo.

> Keep the **79-prompt set fixed across waves** — it is the longitudinal anchor. Add new prompts as a separate layer going forward; never change the original 79.

## 0. Setup (do this first — it's what makes a run reproducible)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| **US proxy** | Windscribe **browser extension**, location **Atlanta – Peachtree**. Apply to the browser tools (ChatGPT scraper, Bing tools). Without it, ChatGPT injects non-US localized searches. |
| **Accounts** | One ChatGPT **Business** (enterprise/edu tier), one **Plus** (consumer). Always run in **Temporary Chat**. |
| **API keys** | `SERPAPI_API_KEY` (Google). `GEMINI_API_KEY` (for the DNA classifier / Gemini path). |
| **Extensions** | Load unpacked from `tools/` at `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked. |

SerpApi (Google) sets US locale **in code** (`location: "United States"`), so it does **not** use the Windscribe proxy. Browser tools do.

## 1. Collect ChatGPT responses — `tools/ChatGPT Response Scraper`

**This is the primary extractor.** No manual DevTools needed.

**Input** — `prompt_id,query` CSV (`tools/ChatGPT Response Scraper/input_template.csv`):
```
prompt_id,query
P0001,What are some free AI tools for audio transcription?
```
Run each tier **separately**, **3 runs per prompt**, in Temporary Chat + proxy.

**Output** — one CSV row per run. Key columns:
```
prompt_id, run_number, query, generated_search_query,
hidden_queries_json,            # the fan-out queries (feeds steps 3–4)
content_references_json,        # the rich citation data (provider, rank, channel)
sources_cited_json,             # inline citations (read from the DOM "More" divider)
sources_additional_json,        # "More" panel links (DOM)
resolved_model_slug,            # which model actually answered — CHECK THIS
response_text, web_search_triggered, sonic_classification_json
```

**`content_references_json` → items** carry the per-citation ground truth (this is the rich part):
```json
{
  "url": "https://www.synthesia.io/post/best-video-translator-apps",
  "result_source": "bing",                                  // provider: bing | bright | labrador | serp  (GPT-5.5+ only)
  "refs": [{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}], // ref_type = channel; ref_index = rank in provider's list
  "title": "10 Best AI Video Translation Tools of 2026"
}
```
- `result_source` = the actual retrieval provider. **Exists only in GPT-5.5+.**
- `ref_type` = channel (search / news / academia / product).
- `ref_index` = the rank the provider returned the result at (0-based).

---

## 1b. Build citation mappings — `scripts/extract_citation_mappings.mjs`

Turns the raw network captures into per-run **claim-to-source** mappings (used for the semantic-fidelity / attribution analysis).

**Input** — `datapass/raw_network_responses/` (raw captures) + the ChatGPT results CSV.

```bash
node scripts/extract_citation_mappings.mjs
```

**Output** — one JSON per run in `datapass/citation_mappings/{run}_mapping.json`:
```json
{
  "run_id": "P001_r1", "account_type": "enterprise",
  "prompt": "Which free AI would you recommend for translating my video?",
  "metadata": { "hidden_queries": [...], "sonic_classification": { "simple_search_prob": 0.97, ... } },
  "citation_mappings": [ { "url": "...", "claim_text": "...", "source": {...} } ],
  "source_summary": {...}, "response_stats": {...}
}
```

> **Note:** this script resolves each citation's source via `search_result_groups`, which was fully populated in **GPT-5.2**. On **GPT-5.5** that field is near-empty (the data moved into `content_references` items with `result_source`/`ref_index`), so the script needs adapting to read sources from `content_references` for newer waves.

---

## 2. Extract fan-out queries

From each run's `hidden_queries_json`. These — not the original prompt — are what you scrape the engines for.

**Sample:**
```json
["best free AI video translation tools 2026 dubbing subtitles"]
```
Build a `run_id,query` CSV from these for steps 3–4.

---

## 3. Scrape Bing — `tools/Bing Results Scraper`

Via proxy. This single tool collects Bing organic results **and** page content, run to depth ~200 (Bing's pagination is unstable, so depth is required — displaced results scatter deep rather than moving to page 2). The content-extraction toggle controls how much page text is pulled (`0` = metadata only, safer/faster).

**Input** — `run_id,query` CSV (the fan-out queries):
```
run_id,query
P0001_r1,best free AI video translation tools 2026 dubbing subtitles
```

**Output** — one row per result, with rank + page + content:
```
run_id, query, position, page_num, url, title, snippet, domain, content
P0001_r1, "best free AI video translation tools 2026", 1, 1, https://www.unite.ai/best-ai-video-translation-tools/, "10 Best AI Video Translation Tools...", "...", unite.ai, "<extracted page text>"
```

> **TODO: confirm** — exact depth/pagination setting used to reach ~rank 200.

---

## 4. Scrape Google — `scripts/collect_serpapi_results.mjs`

```bash
SERPAPI_API_KEY=... node scripts/collect_serpapi_results.mjs --v3
```
`--v2`/`--v3` route to per-version output dirs so earlier waves aren't overwritten. ~28 organic results/query (≈2 pages) — Google is **not** scraped deep.

**Output** — one JSON per query in `data/serpapi_v3_google_results/`:
```json
{
  "_query_info": { "run_id":"P0001_r1_business_Q1", "chatgpt_run_id":"P0001_r1",
                   "account_type":"business", "query":"best free AI video translation tools 2026" },
  "organic_results": [ { "url":"...", "title":"5 Best AI video translator tools [2026]", "_global_position":1 } ]
}
```

---

## 5. Normalize + match

Normalize URLs (strip `utm_*`, `gclid`, trailing slash, lowercase host), then check which **cited** URLs appear in the Bing/Google results for the same run → the overlap / "invisible" rate, per tier.

---

## 6. Content / DNA enrichment

For structural-feature analysis of cited (and additional) URLs.

1. **Node fetch** — `scripts/ingest/fetch_content_v2.mjs` (cheerio extraction → `data/fetched_content/{hash}.txt`). Skips wikipedia/reddit/arxiv/app-stores/social (handled by domain rule).
2. **URL Content Fetcher extension** (`tools/URL Content Fetcher`) — for the ~13% the Node fetcher 403s on. Input: CSV with a `url` column → outputs `content`, `page_title`, `meta_description`, etc.
3. **Classify** — LLM labeler with `prompts/page_label_dna_only_v1.txt` (GPT-5-mini / Gemini-Flash) → page type + structural features → append to `data/enrichment/full_url_dna_database.csv`.

**DNA row** (per URL): `type, has_tables, has_numbered_lists, has_bullet_points, has_pros_cons, freshness_cue_strength, is_vendor_owned, primary_intent, tone, ...`

---

## 7. Inspect / validate — the viewer

Load the matched + enriched data into [`geo-data-viewer`](https://github.com/Saccarab/geo-data-viewer) to browse runs, overlaps, and per-domain breakdowns.

---

## 8. Gemini path (separate from ChatGPT)

- Responses via the **Vertex AI API** (Gemini 3.0 Flash) — grounding metadata is native (`webSearchQueries`, grounding chunks).
- **`tools/VertexResolverExtension`** resolves Vertex redirect URLs to real destinations.
- Google baseline via the same SerpApi collector (`--gemini` mode reads `webSearchQueries`).

---

## Validity checks before trusting a batch

- **ChatGPT scraper:** confirm the "More" divider was found (else the cited/additional split is wrong — the scraper logs `divider found/NOT found`); confirm `content_references` is non-empty.
- **Model routing:** check `resolved_model_slug` — the consumer tier sometimes routes ~⅓ of runs to a mini model (e.g. `gpt-5-3-mini`).
- **Bing page-1 truncation:** if page 1 returned only 2–4 organic results, the deep (rank-200) pass is required — displaced results scatter deep, they don't move to page 2.
- **SerpApi cap:** ~28 organic/query — don't expect deep Google.
- **`search_result_groups`** is near-empty on GPT-5.5 — the raw retrieved pool / "unsurfaced" links are no longer exposed; everything moved to `content_references` items.

---

## Output conventions

> **TODO: confirm** — canonical folder structure and file-naming. Observed: per-version SerpApi dirs (`data/serpapi_v{2,3}_google_results/`), fetched content at `data/fetched_content/{sha256-16}.txt`, dated CSV exports (`chatgpt_results_<ISO>.csv`, `bing_results_<ISO>.csv`).

| Treat as… | Files |
|---|---|
| **Raw evidence** | ChatGPT scraper CSVs, Bing scrape CSVs, SerpApi JSONs, `data/fetched_content/` |
| **Processed** | normalized/matched tables, `full_url_dna_database.csv` |
| **Viewer-only** | aggregates the viewer builds from the above |
